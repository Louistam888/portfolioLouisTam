            <p class="mainText">Hello and pleasure to meet you. 
            
            I'm Louis - I am a community-minded, frontend web developer who comes to tech after a long career in broader public sector marketing communications, and as an award-winning community news reporter. For many years, I ran my own events photography business. 

            I'm looking to join a collaborative team where I can continue to grow my development skills, while also using my skills to improve the communities around me. 

            When I'm not coding, I love flying drones (I'm a certified drone pilot and level 1 drone thermographer) and sharpening my photography and videography skills in the countryside.
